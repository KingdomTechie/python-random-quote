The Lord Is not slow regarding His Promises
It’s not fully shipped until it’s fast
Do not add anything to The Revelation of Jesus Christ
"Be Holy, As I AM Holy"
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak The Oracles of God
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
